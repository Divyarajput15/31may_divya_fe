        <h3>what are the html entities ? with example</h3>
        <p>HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters in HTML. These entities are necessary because certain characters, such as the less than sign (<) or greater than sign (>), can be confused with HTML tags if they are not properly encoded. By using HTML entities, these characters can be displayed as intended without affecting the structure of the HTML code.
            
                        There are two ways to represent HTML entities: using an entity name or using an entity number. An entity name is a descriptive name enclosed in ampersand (&) and semicolon (;), while an entity number is a numeric value preceded by an ampersand (&) and hash (#) symbol.
                        
                        For example, to display a less than sign (<), we can use the entity name `&lt;` or the entity number `&#60;`. similarly, the greater than sign (>) can be represented as `&gt;` or `&#62;`.
                        
                        Here are some commonly used HTML entities:
                        
                        - Non-breaking space: `&nbsp;` or `&#160;` - represents a space that will not break into a new line.
                        - Ampersand: `&amp;` or `&#38;` - represents the ampersand character itself.
                        - Double quotation mark: `&quot;` or `&#34;` - represents a double quotation mark.
                        - Single quotation mark (apostrophe): `&apos;` or `&#39;` - represents a single quotation mark.
                        - Cent sign: `&cent;` or `&#162;` - represents the cent currency symbol.
                        - Pound sign: `&pound;` or `&#163;` - represents the pound currency symbol.
                        - Yen sign: `&yen;` or `&#165;` - represents the yen currency symbol.
                        - Euro sign: `&euro;` or `&#8364;` - represents the euro currency symbol.
                        - Copyright symbol: `&copy;` or `&#169;` - represents the copyright symbol.
                        - Registered trademark symbol: `&reg;` or `&#174;` - represents the registered trademark symbol.
                        
                        
                        By using HTML entities, you can ensure that special characters are correctly displayed in HTML documents without causing any parsing or rendering issues.</p>
