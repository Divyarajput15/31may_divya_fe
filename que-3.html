        <h3>what are the void elements in html?  with example</h3>
        <p>
            Void elements in HTML are elements that do not have any closing tags and cannot contain any child nodes such as nested elements or text nodes. These elements are self-closing, meaning they only have a start tag and no end tag. Void elements are defined in the HTML, SVG, and MathML specifications, and they have specific purposes within the markup structure of a webpage.
                        
                        Here are some examples of void elements in HTML:
                        
                        1. `<br>`: Represents a line break or carriage return within text.
                        Example: `</p>
                        <p>Hello<br>world!</p>` produces:
                        ```
                        Hello
                        world!
                        ```
                        
                        2. `<img>`: Inserts an image into the document.
                        Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`
                        
                        3. `<input>`: Creates an input field for user input.
                        Example: `<input type="text" name="username">`
                        
                        4. `<link>`: Establishes a link between the current document and an external resource, typically a CSS stylesheet.
                        Example: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
                        
                        5. `<meta>`: Provides metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding and page description.
                        Example: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
                        
                        6. `<hr>`: Represents a thematic break or horizontal rule.
                        Example: `<hr>`
