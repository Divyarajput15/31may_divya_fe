    <h3>what are the difference between inline and block level element ?</h3>
    <p>
        Inline and block-level elements in HTML have different behaviors and characteristics:

1. Block-level elements:
   - Start on a new line.
   - Take up the full width available, stretching from the left to the right.
   - Add some space (margin) before and after the element.
   - Examples of block-level elements include `<p>`, `<div>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<table>`.
   - Block-level elements are often used for creating sections, paragraphs, lists, and containers for other elements.

2. Inline elements:
   - Do not start on a new line; they appear within the flow of surrounding content.
   - Only take up as much width as necessary based on their content.
   - Inline elements cannot contain block-level elements.
   - Examples of inline elements include `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`.
   - Inline elements are commonly used for styling specific parts of text or adding links.

Understanding the differences between inline and block-level elements is crucial for proper layout and structuring of HTML documents. Block-level elements provide structure and allow for spacing and positioning, while inline elements flow within the content without disrupting the layout.
