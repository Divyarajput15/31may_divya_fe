        <h3>what is svg ?</h3>
        <p>
            SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an XML-based markup language used to describe two-dimensional vector graphics [1]. SVG is a text-based, open web standard that allows images to be rendered cleanly at any size. Similar to how HTML is used for text, SVG is used for graphics on the web [1].
            
            The main advantage of SVG is that it enables images to be scaled without losing quality. Unlike bitmapped image formats like JPEG or PNG, which become pixelated when scaled up, SVG images remain sharp and clear at any size [1]. This scalability makes SVG particularly useful for responsive web design, where images need to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
            
            SVG images are defined in XML text files, making them searchable, indexable, and compressible. They can be created and edited using text editors or dedicated drawing software [1]. SVG also integrates well with other web technologies such as CSS, DOM, JavaScript, and SMIL, allowing for dynamic and interactive graphics on web pages.
            
            Here's a simple example of SVG code:


            <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="200" height="200">
                <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" fill="red"/>
            </svg>
            In this example, an SVG element is defined with a width and height of 200 pixels. Inside the SVG element, a circle is drawn with a center at coordinates (100, 100), a radius of 50 pixels, and filled with red color [2].
            
            SVG has gained widespread support among modern web browsers, and its adoption has increased over the years. It provides advantages such as not requiring plugins, allowing mixing with other web content, and improving rendering and scripting reliability.
