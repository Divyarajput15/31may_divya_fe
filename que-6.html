        <h3>what is the `class` attributes in html ? with example</h3>
        <p>
            The `class` attribute in HTML is used to specify one or more class names for an element. It allows elements to be grouped and styled together using CSS or targeted and manipulated using JavaScript. Multiple HTML elements can share the same class, and an element can have multiple classes assigned to it by separating the class names with spaces.
            
            Here's an example of how the `class` attribute is used:
            
            ```html
            <div class="city">
                <h2>London</h2>
                <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="city">
                <h2>Paris</h2>
                <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="city">
                <h2>Tokyo</h2>
                <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
            </div>
            ```
            
            In this example, three `<div>` elements have the class attribute set to "city". All three elements will be styled equally according to the CSS rules defined for the `.city` class. Similarly, you can apply styles to multiple elements by assigning the same class name to them.
                
                The class attribute can be used with any HTML element, and its value is a space-separated list of class names. It's worth noting that class names are case-sensitive. The recommended practice is to use class names that describe the semantic purpose of the element rather than its presentation.</p>
