    <h2>1. What are the benefits of using CSS?</h2>
<p>
  - Separation of Style and Content: CSS allows for a clear distinction between the structure (HTML) and the presentation (CSS) of a webpage, making maintenance and updates easier.<br>
  - Consistency: CSS enables a uniform look across multiple pages by centralizing styling rules.<br>
  - Efficiency: Code becomes cleaner as styles are defined in one place rather than repeated inline.<br>
  - Flexibility: Design elements like fonts, colors, and layout can be customized with precision.
</p>

<h2>2. What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h2>
<p>
  - Browser Compatibility: CSS can behave differently in various browsers, requiring additional effort for cross-browser consistency.<br>
  - Learning Curve: Understanding CSS thoroughly, especially its advanced features, demands a learning curve.<br>
  - Design Limitations: Complex designs might be challenging to achieve due to CSS limitations.<br>
  - Maintenance Complexity: Large CSS files can become unwieldy, making maintenance and updates challenging.
</p>

<h2>3. What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h2>
<p>
  - CSS2: Focused on basic styling features like text formatting, positioning, and layout.<br>
  - CSS3: Introduces advanced capabilities including animations, transitions, gradients, and rounded corners.
</p>

<h2>4. Name a few CSS style components.</h2>
<p>
  - Fonts: CSS allows control over font properties such as font-family, font-size, and font-weight.<br>
  - Colors: Styling attributes like color, background-color, and border-color define color choices.<br>
  - Margins/Padding: CSS properties like margin and padding adjust spacing around elements.
</p>

<h2>5. What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h2>
<p>
  - CSS Opacity: Opacity defines the transparency level of an element, ranging from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).<br>
  - Example: To apply a semi-transparent red background:<br>
    <code>.transparent-box {<br>
      background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);<br>
    }</code>
</p>

<h2>6. How can the background color of an element be changed?</h2>
<p>
  - Changing Background Color: The background-color property sets the background color of an element.<br>
  - Example: To create a green background:<br>
    <code>.colored-box {<br>
      background-color: #00ff00;<br>
    }</code>
</p>

<h2>7. How can image repetition of the background be controlled?</h2>
<p>
  - Controlling Background Repetition: The background-repeat property manages how a background image repeats.<br>
  - Example: To repeat an image only horizontally:<br>
    <code>.patterned-bg {<br>
      background-repeat: repeat-x;<br>
    }</code>
</p>

<h2>8. What is the use of the background-position property?</h2>
<p>
  - Background Positioning: background-position places a background image within its container.<br>
  - Example: To center an image horizontally and align it to the top:<br>
    <code>.bg-position {<br>
      background-position: center top;<br>
    }</code>
</p>

<h2>9. Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h2>
<p>
  - Background Attachment: background-attachment determines if a background image scrolls with content.<br>
  - Example: To fix an image while scrolling:<br>
    <code>.fixed-bg {<br>
      background-attachment: fixed;<br>
    }</code> 
</p>

<h2>10. Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h2>
<p> 
  - Separation for Clearer Styling: Isolating background and color properties improves readability and prevents conflicts.<br> 
  - Example: To set background and text color:<br> 
    <code>.styled-element {<br> 
      background-color: #f0f0f0;<br> 
      color: #333;<br> 
    }</code> 
</p>

<h2>11. How to center block elements using CSS1?</h2> 
<p> 
  - Centering with CSS1: Set a fixed width and use auto margins for horizontal centering.<br> 
  - Example: To center a block with 50% width:<br> 
    <code>.centered {<br> 
      width: 50%;<br> 
      margin: 0 auto;<br> 
    }</code> 
</p>

<h2>12. How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h2>
<p>
  - Staying Updated: Regularly consult W3C's CSS specifications and adhere to recommended practices.
</p>

<h2>13. What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h2>
<p>
  - Inline Styles: Apply styles directly within HTML tags using the style attribute.<br>
  - Embedded Styles: Insert CSS within "<style></style>" tags in the HTML .
  - External Stylesheets: Link to an external CSS file using the <link> tag in the HTML <head>.
</p>

<h2>14. What is embedded style sheets?</h2>
<p>
    Embedded Styles CSS rules placed within 
    <!-- `<style>` tags in the HTML `<head>`,  -->
    applying specifically to that document.
</p>

<h2>15. What are external style sheets?</h2>
<p>
  - External Stylesheets: Separate CSS files linked to HTML documents via the <link> element, promoting reusability.
</p>

<h2>16. Advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h2>
<p>
  - Advantages: Consistent design, caching for faster load times, and centralized maintenance.<br>
  - Disadvantages: Additional HTTP request, potential for specificity conflicts.
</p>

<h2>17. What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h2>
<p>
  - CSS Selector: A CSS selector is a pattern that identifies which HTML elements the associated styles should be applied to.
</p>

<h2>18. What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h2>
<p>
  - Media Types: CSS supports various media types such as screen, print, and speech, allowing styles to be adapted for different outputs.
</p>

<h2>19. What is the rule set?</h2>
<p>
  - CSS Rule Set: A rule set consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector specifies the target element, and the declaration block contains property-value pairs for styling.
