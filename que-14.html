            The `<span>` tag in HTML is used as an inline container to mark up a part of text or a section of a document. It allows you to group inline elements together for styling or manipulation purposes using CSS or JavaScript . Here's an example code demonstrating the usage of the `<span>` tag:
                                
                                            ```html
                    <p>My mother has
                        <span style="color:blue">blue</span>
                        eyes.</p>
                    ```
                                                    
                                                    In this example, the word "blue" is wrapped within a `<span>` tag and styled with the `color` attribute set to "blue". This will render the word "blue" in blue color within the sentence "My mother has blue eyes."
                                                            
                                                            The `<span>` tag can be styled using CSS classes as well. Here's an example:
                                                            
                                                            ```html
                            <p>This is a
                                <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>
                                text.</p>

                            <style>
                                .highlight {
                                    background-color: yellow;
                                    font-weight: bold;
                                }
                            </style>
                            ```
                                                                    
                                                                    In this example, the word "highlighted" is wrapped within a `<span>` tag with the class "highlight". The corresponding CSS styles the text with a yellow background color and bold font weight. As a result, the word "highlighted" will appear with a yellow background and bold font weight.
                                                                            
                                                                            Additionally, the `<span>` tag can be used to manipulate elements with JavaScript. By assigning an id to the `<span>` element, you can access and manipulate it using JavaScript. Here's an example:
                                                                            
                                                                            ```html
                                        <p>The text,
                                            <span id="uppercase">freecodecamp</span>, was turned to uppercase with JavaScript.</p>


                                    </body>
                                </html>
