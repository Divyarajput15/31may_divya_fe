        <h3>how to use iframe tag ? with example</h3>
        <p>
            
            The<iframe>  tag in HTML is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. It allows you to display external content, such as webpages or media, within your web page. Here's an example of how to use the
                <iframe>
                    tag:
                                                            
                    ```html
                    <iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="500" height="300" title="Embedded Content"></iframe>
                    ```
                                                                        
                    In the above example:
                    - `src` specifies the URL of the document or webpage you want to embed. Replace `"https://www.example.com"` with the desired URL.
                    - `width` and `height` determine the dimensions of the embedded content in pixels. You can adjust these values as needed.
                    - `title` provides a description for the embedded content. It's recommended to include a meaningful title for accessibility purposes.

                    Additionally, you can use CSS to style the
                    <iframe>
                        tag further. For instance, you can add a border around the embedded content:
                                                                                    
                                                                                    ```html
                        <iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="500" height="300" title="Embedded Content" style="border: 1px solid black;"></iframe>
                        ```
                                                                                    
                        Remember that the content displayed within the
                        <iframe>
                            tag should be accessible and allowed by the source website. Make sure to comply with any terms of use or restrictions imposed by the website you are embedding.
