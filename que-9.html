        <h3>how is cell padding is different from cell spacing ? with example
        </h3>
        <p>
            Cell padding and cell spacing are two attributes used in table formatting in HTML. The main difference between them lies in their purpose and effect.
            
            Cell padding controls the space between the border of a table cell and its contents. It specifies the whitespace between the cell edge and the content of the cell. This attribute is defined using the `cellpadding` property within the `<table>` tag. For example, `<table cellpadding="4">` sets a cell padding of 4 pixels. Cell padding is mainly used to add spacing within a single cell. It affects the space inside the cell, between the cell border (even if invisible) and the cell content.
                
            On the other hand, cell spacing controls the space between adjacent cells. It defines the whitespace between the edges of the adjacent cells. The `cellspacing` attribute is used within the `<table>` tag to specify the space between cells. For instance, `<table cellspacing="5">` sets a cell spacing of 5 pixels. Cell spacing affects the space between multiple cells in a table, making the gaps between them wider or narrower.
                
            To illustrate the difference, consider the following example:
                
                ```html
                            <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="5">
                                <thead>
                                    <td>
                                        <span>Name</span>
                                    </td>
                                    <td>
                                        <span>Age</span>
                                    </td>
                                </thead>
                                <tbody>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Rani</td>
                                        <td>30</td>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Rajan</td>
                                        <td>35</td>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Akshaya</td>
                                        <td>17</td>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Ashick</td>
                                        <td>13</td>
                                    </tr>
                                </tbody>
                            </table>
                            ```
                            
            In this example, the `cellpadding` attribute sets the spacing within each cell, specifying the distance between the cell content and the cell border. Meanwhile, the `cellspacing` attribute determines the spacing between adjacent cells, controlling the gaps between them. The result is a table with both internal padding within cells and spacing between cells .
