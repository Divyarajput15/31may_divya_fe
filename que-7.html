        <h3>what is the difference between class and id attribute of html elemnets ? with example</h3>
        <p>
            The class and id attributes in HTML are used to identify and style specific elements on a webpage, but they have some key differences.
            
            The id attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to an HTML element. It ensures that only one element on the page can have a specific id value, making it ideal for targeting a single element with CSS or JavaScript. For example, if we have an element with the id "myHeader" like this: `<h1 id="myHeader">Hello</h1>`, we can style it using CSS by referring to its id: `#myHeader { color: blue; }`.
                
                On the other hand, the class attribute is used to assign a class or group identifier to one or more elements. Multiple elements can share the same class, allowing them to be styled collectively. For example, if we have several elements with the class "city" like this: `<h2 class="city">London</h2>`, `<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>`, we can style them using CSS by referring to their class: `.city { color: red; }`.
                
                To summarize:
                - The id attribute is used to uniquely identify an element on a page and should only be used by a single element.
                - The class attribute is used to identify a group or category of elements that share similar characteristics.
                
                It's important to note that while the id attribute must be unique, the class attribute can be shared among multiple elements. This distinction allows for more flexible styling and targeting options when working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
