    <h3>are the HTML tags and element same thing ?</h3>
    <p>
        HTML tags and elements are not the same, although they are closely related. HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML page and are used to define the structure and formatting of the content. They are represented by opening and closing brackets (< >) and usually exist in pairs. For example, the `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph, and it is written as `<p>...</p>`, with the content of the paragraph placed between the opening and closing tags.

        On the other hand, HTML elements consist of the start tag, content, and end tag. They are components of the web page that are created using HTML tags. For instance, if we create a `<div>` tag and fill it with text, the text-filled div becomes an HTML element. The `<div>...</div>` tags, along with the content inside them, form the HTML element.

        In summary, HTML tags are used to define the structure and formatting, while HTML elements are the components created using those tags. Elements consist of tags along with the content they enclose. So, tags and elements serve different purposes in HTML.
