    <h3>what are the tags and attributes in html ?</h3>
    <p>HTML tags are used in HTML to define the structure and appearance of elements on a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets ("<" and ">") and come in pairs, consisting of an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag indicates the beginning of an element, while the closing tag indicates the end of the element. For example, the `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph, and it is written as `<p>...</p>`, with the content of the paragraph placed between the opening and closing tags.

    Attributes, on the other hand, provide additional information about HTML elements. They are used within the opening tag of an element and are written as name-value pairs. Attributes modify the behavior or appearance of an element. For instance, the `href` attribute in the `<a>` tag specifies the hyperlink URL, and the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag specifies the image source. Attributes are written as `attributeName="attributeValue"` within the opening tag.
    
    By combining different tags and attributes, developers can create structured and interactive webpages. It's important to note that HTML tags define the elements, while attributes provide additional information or instructions for those elements.
