    <h3>how to insert a picture into background image of web page ? with example </h3>

    <p>
        To insert a picture into the background image of a web page, you can use the CSS `background-image` property. Here's an example code under 250 words:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      background-image: url('background.jpg');
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-size: cover;
    }
    h1 {
      color: white;
      text-align: center;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is the content of the web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In the above example, we set the background image for the entire page by targeting the `body` element. The `background-image` property specifies the URL of the image file you want to use as the background. Replace `'background.jpg'` with the actual file path or URL of your desired image.

To prevent the background image from repeating, we set `background-repeat: no-repeat`. This ensures that the image appears only once and does not repeat across the page.

The `background-size: cover` property ensures that the background image covers the entire element without distortion. It scales the image to fit the element's width and height while maintaining its aspect ratio.

Feel free to adjust the styles and customize the HTML content according to your needs. Remember to replace `'background.jpg'` with the appropriate image file path or URL.

Please note that the above code is a basic example, and you may need to modify it further to suit your specific requirements.
